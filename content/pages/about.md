I was born in a family doing estate development. I have started learning design since I were 6. I love design and the happiest moment is when the client praised my design. I completed 8 commercial design projects and 1 residential design project during my college time and most of my clients are from the recommendations of the previous client. I love travelling, learned different styles of architecture from the real world and broad my view. I am a very confident, competent, creative and productive interior designer with extensive experience working on projects in different disciplines both commercial and residential. I work very hard. I am a quick learner and also a very good team player. I am looking for an interior design position to pursuit my career and embrace the new challenge. If you have any position that suits me, please feel free to email me: wuyue911025@gmail.com <a href="/cv_yuewu.pdf" download>CV Download</a>
